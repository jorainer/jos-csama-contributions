# My contributions to the CSAMA workshops

This repository contains all my contributions (lectures and labs) to the CSAMA
Bioconductor workshop. Each year's contributions are available in their own
branch, i.e. if you want to access the contributions for the 2018 edition of
CSAMA [CSAMA2018](http://www-huber.embl.de/csama2018/), check out the branch
`2018`.
