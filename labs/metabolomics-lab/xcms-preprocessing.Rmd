# Abstract

In this document we discuss general MS data access concepts using Bioconductor's
`MSnbase` package [@Gatto:2012io] and walk through the preprocessing of an LC-MS
toy data set using the `xcms` package [@Smith:2006ic] that comprises
chromatographic peak detection, sample alignment and peak
correspondence. Particular emphasis is given on the most important settings of
popular preprocessing methods and how these can be defined depending on the
analyzed data set.


# Introduction

This workflow discusses the first step in the analysis of an LC-MS-based
untargeted metabolomics experiment. If you have any comments, suggestions, find
typos or want to provide general feedback you are welcome to open an issue at
the workshop's repository at [jo's CSAMA
contributions](<https://github.com/jotsetung/jos-csama-contributions>).


## Prerequisites

The analysis in this document requires an R version >= 3.5.0 and recent versions
of the `MSnbase` and `xcms` (version >= 3.3.1 is needed) packages. The code
below installs all packages for the analysis.

```{r  install-required, eval = FALSE, results = "hide" }
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(c("xcms", "MSnbase", "doParallel", "msdata", "magrittr",
           "devtools"))
## Need xcms version > 3.3.1
if (packageVersion("xcms") < "3.3.1")
    devtools::install_github("sneumann/xcms", ref = "master") 
```


## Mass spectrometry

Mass spectrometry allows to measure abundances of charged ions in a
sample. Abundances are determined as ion counts for a specific mass-to-charge
ratio m/z. The measured signal is represented in a spectrum, intensities along
m/z.

![](images/MS.png)

Many ions have the same or a very similar m/z and MS is thus frequently coupled
with a second technology to separate the analytes based on other properties than
their charge (e.g. hydrophilic/hydrophobic). Common choices are gas
chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC). Such a e.g. LC-MS setup
performs thus scans at discrete time points resulting in a set of spectra for a
given sample, with compounds separated both on m/z and on retention time
dimension.

![](images/LCMS.png)

In LC-MS data analysis ions are quantified by identifying and integrating signal
from *chromatographic* peaks.


## Definitions and common naming convention

Naming conventions and terms used throughout this document are:

- chromatographic peak: peak containing the signal from an ion in retention time
  dimension (different from a *mass* peak that represents the signal along the
  m/z dimension within a spectrum.
- chromatographic peak detection: process in which chromatographic peaks are
  identified within each file.
- alignment: process that adjusts for retention time differences between files.
- correspondence: grouping of chromatographic peaks (presumably from the same
  ion) across files.
- feature: chromatographic peaks grouped across files.


# Workflow: metabolomics data preprocessing using `xcms`

This workflow describes the basic data handling (I/O) of mass spectrometry data
using the `MSnbase` package, and the LC/GC-MS data preprocessing using
`xcms`. It showcases the new functionality and user interface functions of
`xcms`, that re-use functionality from the `MSnbase` package. The first part of
the workflow is focused on data import, access and visualization followed by the
description of a simple data centroiding approach and concluded by the
`xcms`-based LC-MS data preprocessing that comprises chromatographic peak
detection, alignment and correspondence. The workflow does not cover data
normalization procedures, compound identification and differential abundance
analysis.


## Data import and representation

In the code block below we load all required libraries and read our toy data
using the `readMSData` function. This data set consists of two files in mzML
format, with signals from pooled human serum samples measured with a ultra high
performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system (Agilent 1290) coupled with a
Q-TOF MS (TripleTOF 5600+ AB Sciex) instrument. Chromatographic separation based
on hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). The system was tuned
to allow measurement of the *polar metabolome*. To reduce file sizes, the data
set was restricted to an m/z range from 105 to 134 and retention times from 0 to
260 seconds. We also define a `data.frame` describing the experiment and pass
this to the `readMSData` function. We thus have all experiment-related
information within the same data object. The option `mode = "onDisk"` tells the
function to read only general metadata into memory. The m/z and intensity values
from the original files are not kept in memory, but retrieved from the original
files on demand. This enables analyses also of very large experiments.

```{r  load-data, message = FALSE }
library(MSnbase)
library(xcms)
library(doParallel)
library(magrittr)

## Define the file names.
fls <- dir(system.file("sciex", package = "msdata"), full.names = TRUE)

## Define a data.frame with additional information on the files.
pd <- data.frame(file = basename(fls),
                 injection_idx = c(1, 19),
                 sample = c("POOL_1", "POOL_2"),
                 group = "POOL")
data <- readMSData(fls, pdata = new("NAnnotatedDataFrame", pd),
                   mode = "onDisk") 
```

Next we set up parallel processing. This ensures that all required cores are
registered and available from the beginning of the analysis. All data access and
analysis functions of `xcms` and `MSnbase` are parallelized on a per-file basis
and will use this setup by default.

```{r  parallel-setup, message = FALSE }
## Set up parallel processing using 2 cores
registerDoParallel(2)
register(bpstart(DoparParam()), default = TRUE) 
```

The MS experiment data is now represented as an `OnDiskMSnExp` object. Phenotype
information can be retrieved with the `pData` function, or directly using
`$`. Below we access sample descriptions.

```{r  show-pData, message = FALSE }
## Access phenotype information
pData(data)

## Or individual columns directly using the $ operator
data$injection_idx 
```

General information on each spectrum in the experiment can be accessed with the
`fData` function, that returns a `data.frame` with one row per spectrum.

```{r  show-fData, message = FALSE }
## Access spectrum header information
head(fData(data)) 
```


## Basic data access and visualization

The MS data in an `OnDiskMSnExp` object is organized by spectrum (similar as in
*mzML* files), with `Spectrum` objects used as containers for the m/z and
intensity values. General spectrum information can be retrieved using the
`msLevel`, `centroided`, `rtime` or `polarity` functions that return the
respective value for all spectra from all files. Here, the `fromFile` function
can be helpful to determine from which file/sample the information comes. This
is shown in the code block below.

```{r  general-access, message = FALSE }
## Get the retention time
head(rtime(data))

## Get the retention times splitted by file.
rts <- split(rtime(data), fromFile(data))

## The result is a list of length 2. The number of spectra per file can
## then be determined with
lengths(rts) 
```

The `spectra` function can be used to retrieve the list of all spectra (from all
files). This will load the full data from all raw files, which can take,
depending on the size of the files and number of spectra, a relatively long time
and requires, depending on the experiment, a considerable amount of memory. In
most cases we will however work anyway with sub-sets of the data, and retrieving
such data can, in the case of indexed mzML, mzXML and CDF files, be very
fast. Data objects can be easily subsetted using the filter functions:
`filterFile`, `filterRtime`, `filterMz` or `filterMsLevel` that filter the data
by file, retention time range, m/z range or MS level. To illustrate this we
retrieve below all spectra measured between 180 and 181 seconds. Note that we
use the pipe operator `%>%` from the `magrittr` package for better readability.

```{r  spectra-filterRt, message = FALSE }
## Get all spectra measured between 180 and 181 seconds
## Use %>% to avoid nested function calls
sps <- data %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(180, 181)) %>%
    spectra 
```

The result is a `list` of `Spectrum` objects. Below we determine the number of
spectra we have got.

```{r  spectra-filterRt-length, message = FALSE }
## How many spectra?
length(sps) 
```

We can use the `fromFile` function to determine from which file/sample each
spectrum is.

```{r  spectra-filterRt-fromFile, message = FALSE }
## From which file?
sapply(sps, fromFile) 
```

We have thus 3 spectra per file. Next we plot the data from the last spectrum
(i.e. the 3rd spectrum in the present retention time window from the second
file).

```{r  spectrum-plot, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Spectrum at a retention time of about 180 seconds." }
plot(sps[[6]]) 
```

We can immediately spot several mass peaks in the spectrum, with the largest one
at a m/z of about 130 and the second largest at about 106, which matches the
expected mass to charge ratio for the [M+H]+ adduct of Serine.

MS data is in general organized by spectrum, but in LC-MS experiments we analyze
the data along the retention time axis and hence orthogonally to this data
representation. To extract such data we can use the `chromatogram` function. The
function aggregates intensities for each scan/retention time along the m/z axis
(i.e. within each spectrum) and returns the retention time - intensity duplets
in a `Chromatogram` object, one per file. The `Chromatogram` object supports,
similar to the `Spectrum` object, the `rtime` and `intensity` functions to
access the respective data. Below we use the `chromatogram` function to extract
the total ion chromatogram (TIC) for each file and plot it.

```{r  chromatogram-tic, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Total ion chromatogram.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5 }
## Get chromatographic data (TIC) for an m/z slice
chr <- chromatogram(data)
chr

## Plot the tic
plot(chr) 
```

The object returned by the `chromatogram` function arranges the individual
`Chromatogram` objects in a two-dimensional array, columns being samples (files)
and rows data slices. Below we extract the (total ion) intensities from the TIC
of the first file.

```{r  chromatogram-tic-intensity, message = FALSE }
ints <- intensity(chr[1, 1])
head(ints) 
```

The object contains also all phenotype information from the original `data`
variable. This can be accessed in the same way than for `OnDiskMSnExp` objects
(or most other data objects in Bioconductor).

```{r  chromatogram-pdata, message = FALSE }
## Access the full phenotype data
pData(chr) 
```

Depending on the parameter `aggregationFun`, the function can produce total ion
chromatograms (TIC), with `aggregationFun = "sum"` or base peak chromatograms
(BPC) with `aggregationFun = "max"`. Below we extract and plot the ion
chromatogram for Serine after first filtering the data object to the retention
time and by m/z ranges containing the signal for this compound.

```{r  serine-xic, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Extracted ion chromatogram for the Serine [M+H]+ ion in both files." }
## Extract and plot the XIC for Serine
data %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(175, 189)) %>%
    filterMz(mz = c(106.02, 106.07)) %>%
    chromatogram(aggregationFun = "max") %>%
    plot() 
```


## Centroiding of profile MS data

MS instruments allow to export data in profile or centroid mode. Profile data
contains the signal for all discrete m/z values (and retention times) for which
the instrument collected data [@Smith:2014di]. For each ion at a given retention
time the instrument measures thus multiple intensities, at m/z values that are
distributed around the ion's *real* m/z value. Centroiding is the process to
reduce these mass peaks to a single representative signal, the centroid. `xcms`,
specifically the *centWave* chromatographic peak detection algorithm, was
designed for centroided data, thus, prior to data analysis, profile data should
be centroided. The `MSnbase` package provides the basic toolset to perform
centroiding (and data smoothing): `pickPeaks` and `smooth`.

Below we inspect the profile data for the [M+H]+ ion adduct of Serine. We subset
the data to the m/z and retention time range containing signal from Serine and
`plot` the data with `type = "XIC"`, that generates a combined chromatographic
and *map* visualization of the data (i.e. a plot of the individual m/z, rt and
intensity data tuples with data points colored by their intensity in the m/z -
retention time space).

```{r  serine-profile-mode-data, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Profile data for Serine.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, fig.pos = "h!", warning = FALSE }
## Filter the MS data to the signal from the Serine ion and plot it using
## type = "XIC"
data %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(175, 189)) %>%
    filterMz(mz = c(106.02, 106.07)) %>%
    plot(type = "XIC") 
```

The plot shows all data points measured by the instrument. It clearly shows the
mass peaks for Serine, that are represented by a distribution of signal in both
retention time and m/z dimension.

Next we smooth the data in each spectrum using a Savitzky-Golay filter, which
usually improves data quality by reducing noise. Subsequently we perform a
centroiding analysis based on a simple peak-picking strategy that reports the
maximum signal for each mass peak in each spectrum.

```{r  centroiding, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Centroided data for Serine.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, fig.pos = "h!", warning = FALSE }
## Smooth the signal, then do a simple peak picking.
data_cent <- data %>%
    smooth(method = "SavitzkyGolay", halfWindowSize = 6) %>%
    pickPeaks()

## Plot the centroided data for Serine
data_cent %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(175, 189)) %>%
    filterMz(mz = c(106.02, 106.07)) %>%
    plot(type = "XIC") 
```

As expected, centroiding successfully reduced the data to a single data point
for an ion in each spectrum. For more advanced centroiding options that also
fine-tune the m/z value of the reported centroid see the `pickPeaks` help or the
centroiding vignette in `MSnbase`.

Note that, since the MS data is not loaded in memory, smoothing and centroiding
is applied to the data *on-the-fly* each time that m/z or intensity values are
requested from the data object `data_cent`. To make any data manipulation on an
`OnDiskMSnExp` object *persistent* we need to export and re-read the data. Below
we save thus the centroided data as mzML files and read the exported data again.

```{r  export-centroided-prepare, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, results = "hide" }
## Silently removing exported mzML files if they do already exist.
lapply(basename(fileNames(data)), function (z) {
    if (file.exists(z))
        file.remove(z)
})
```

```{r  export-centroided, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE }
## Write the centroided data to files with the same names in the current
## directory
fls_new <- basename(fileNames(data))
writeMSData(data_cent, file = fls_new)

## Read the centroided data.
data_cent <- readMSData(fls_new, pdata = new("NAnnotatedDataFrame", pd),
                        mode = "onDisk") 
```


## LC-MS data preprocessing


### Chromatographic peak detection

Chromatographic peak detection aims to identify peaks along the retention time
axis that represent the signal from individual compounds' ions. This can be
performed with the `findChromPeaks` function and one of different algorithms
that are selected depending on the submitted parameter object: with
`MatchedFilterParam` it performs peak detection as described in the original
xcms article [@Smith:2006ic]. With `CentWaveParam` a continuous wavelet
transformation (CWT)-based peak detection is performed that can detect close-by
and partially overlapping peaks with different widths [@Tautenhahn:2008fx]. With
`MassifquantParam` it performs a Kalman filter-based peak detection
[@Conley:2014ha]. Additional peak detection algorithms for direct injection data
are also available, but not discussed here.

We use the *centWave* algorithm that performs peak detection in two steps: first
it identifies regions of interest in the m/z - retention time space and
subsequently detects peaks in these regions using a continuous wavelet transform
(see the original publication for more details). centWave can be configured with
several parameters (see `?CentWaveParam`), with the most important ones being
`peakwidth` and `ppm`. `peakwidth` defines the minimal and maximal expected
width of the peak in retention time dimension and depends thus on the LC setting
of the LC-MS system used to measure the data. Appropriate values for this
parameter can be defined based on extracted ion chromatograms of known
compounds. Below we extract chromatographic data for Serine and perform a peak
detection on the `Chromatogram` object using the default parameters for
centWave.

```{r  centWave-default, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "XIC for Serine", results = "hide" }
## Get the XIC for serine in the first file
srn_chr <- chromatogram(data_cent, rt = c(165, 200),
                        mz = c(106.03, 106.06),
                        aggregationFun = "max")[1, 1]
## Plot the data
par(mfrow = c(1, 1), mar = c(4, 4.5, 1, 1))
plot(srn_chr)

## Get default centWave parameters
cwp <- CentWaveParam()

## "dry-run" peak detection on the XIC.
findChromPeaks(srn_chr, param = cwp) 
```

The warning message tells us that centWave failed to find any peak in the
provided data. Looking at the default values for the centWave parameters helps
understanding why the peak detection failed:

```{r  centWave-default-parameters, message = FALSE }
cwp 
```

The default settings for `peakwidth` are 20 to 50 seconds, while from the plot
above it is apparent that the chromatographic peak for Serine is about 4 seconds
wide. Below we adapt the settings to accommodate peaks ranging from 2 to 10
seconds and re-run the peak detection. In general, it is advised to investigate
peak widths for several ions in the data set to determine the most appropriate
`peakwidth` setting.

```{r  centWave-adapted, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "XIC for Serine with detected chromatographic peak", results = "hide" }
cwp <- CentWaveParam(peakwidth = c(2, 10))

pks <- findChromPeaks(srn_chr, param = cwp)

## Plot the data and higlight identified peak area
plot(srn_chr)
rect(pks[, "rtmin"], 0, pks[, "rtmax"], pks[, "maxo"], border = "#00000040") 
```

Another important parameter is `ppm` which is used in the initial identification
of the regions of interest. In contrast to random noise, the *real* signal from
an ion is expected to yield stable m/z values in consecutive scans (the
scattering of the m/z values around the *real* m/z value of the ion is supposed
to be inversely related with its intensity). In centWave, all data points that
differ by less than `ppm` in consecutive spectra are combined into a region of
interest that is then subject for the CWT-based peak detection. To illustrate
this, we plot the full data for Serine.

```{r  Serine-mz-scattering-plot, message = FALSE }
## Restrict the data to signal from Sering
srn <- data_cent %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(179, 186)) %>%
    filterMz(mz = c(106.04, 106.06))

## Plot the data
plot(srn, type = "XIC") 
```

As expected, higher intensity signals tend to scatter less in m/z dimension. We
next calculate the differences in m/z values between consecutive scans in this
data subset.

```{r  define-ppm, message = FALSE }
## Extract the Serine data for one file as a data.frame
srn_df <- as(filterFile(srn, 1), "data.frame")

## The difference between m/z values from consecutive scans expressed
## in ppm
diff(srn_df$mz) * 1e6 / mean(srn_df$mz) 
```

The difference in m/z values for the Serine data is thus between 0 and 27
ppm. This should ideally be evaluated for several compounds and should be set to
a value that allows to capture the full chromatographic peaks for most of the
tested compounds. We can next perform the peak detection using our settings for
the `ppm` and `peakwidth` parameters.

```{r  findPeaks-centWave, message = FALSE }
## Perform peak detection
cwp <- CentWaveParam(peakwidth = c(2, 10), ppm = 30)
data_cent <- findChromPeaks(data_cent, param = cwp) 
```

The result from the `findChromPeaks` call is an `XCMSnExp` object which contains
all preprocessing results and, by extending the `OnDiskMSnExp` object, inherits
all of its functionality that has been described so far. The results from the
peak detection analysis can be accessed with the `chromPeaks` function, that,
with the optional `rt` and `mz` parameters, allows to extract identified
chromatographic peaks from specific areas in the data. Below we extract all
identified peaks for a certain m/z - rt area.

```{r  xcmsnexp, message = FALSE }
## Access the peak detection results from a specific m/z - rt area
chromPeaks(data_cent, mz = c(106, 107), rt = c(150, 190)) 
```

For each identified peak the m/z and rt value of the apex is reported (columns
"mz" and "rt") as well as their ranges ("mzmin", "mzmax", "rtmin", "rtmax"), the
integrated signal of the peak (i.e. the peak area "into"), the maximal signal of
the peak ("maxo"), the signal to noise ratio ("sn") and the index of the sample
in which the peak was detected ("sample").  For quality assessment we could now
calculate summary statistics on the identified peaks to e.g. identify samples
with much less detected peaks. Also, we can use the `plotChromPeaks` function to
provide some general information on the location of the identified
chromatographic peaks in the m/z - rt space.

```{r  plotChromPeaks, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Location of the identified chromatographic peaks in the m/z - rt space." }
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plotChromPeaks(data_cent, 1)
plotChromPeaks(data_cent, 2) 
```


### Alignment

While chromatography helps to discriminate between analytes it is also affected
by variances that lead to shifts in retention times between measurement
runs. The alignment step aims to adjust these retention time differences between
samples in an experiment. Below we plot the base peak chromatograms of both
files of our toy data set to visualize these differences.

```{r  alignment-bpc-raw, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "BPC of all files.", fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4 }
## Extract base peak chromatograms
bpc_raw <- chromatogram(data_cent, aggregationFun = "max")
plot(bpc_raw) 
```

While both samples were measured with the same setup on the same day there are
still differences observable in the BPCs above.

Alignment can be performed with `xcms` using the `adjustRtime` function that
supports the *peakGroups* [@Smith:2006ic] and the *obiwarp* [@Prince:2006jj]
method. The settings for the algorithms can be defined with the
`PeakGroupsParam` and the `ObiwarpParam` parameter objects, respectively.

For our example we use the peakGroups method that aligns samples based on the
retention times of *hook peaks*, which are supposed to be present in most
samples. Prior to alignment we have thus to identify these peaks, which is
accomplished by the *peakDensity* correspondence analysis method. Details about
this method and explanations on the choices of its parameters are provided in
the next section. After having performed this initial correspondence, we perform
the alignment using the settings `minFraction = 1` and `span =
0.6`. `minFraction` defines the proportion of samples in which a peak from the
peak group (feature) has to be detected/present. A value of 0.9 would
e.g. require that a chromatographic peak was detected in 90% of all samples of
the experiment. Our data represents replicated measurements of the same sample
pool and we can thus assume that for hook peaks a peak was identified in each
file. The parameter `span` defines the degree of smoothing of the loess function
that is used to allow different regions along the retention time axis to be
adjusted by a different factor. A value of 0 will most likely cause overfitting,
while 1 would perform a constant, linear shift. Values between 0.4 and 0.6 seem
to be reasonable for most experiments.

```{r  alignment-correspondence, message = FALSE }
## Define the settings for the initial peak grouping - details for
## choices in the next section.
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group, bw = 1.8,
                        minFraction = 1, binSize = 0.02)
data_cent <- groupChromPeaks(data_cent, pdp)

## Define settings for the alignment
pgp <- PeakGroupsParam(minFraction = 1, span = 0.6)
data_cent <- adjustRtime(data_cent, param = pgp) 
```

Adjusted retention times are stored, along with the raw retention times, within
the result object. Any function accessing retention times (such as `rtime`) will
by default return adjusted retention times from an `XCMSnExp` object, if
present. Note that also the retention times of the identified chromatographic
peaks are adjusted by the `adjustRtime` call. After alignment it is suggested to
inspect the differences between raw and adjusted retention times.

```{r  alignment-result, message = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4, fig.cap = "Alignment results. Shown is the difference between raw and adjusted retention times and the hook peaks that were used for the alignment (shown as points)." }
## Plot the difference between raw and adjusted retention times
plotAdjustedRtime(data_cent) 
```

The difference between raw and adjusted retention time should be reasonable. In
our example it is mostly below one second, which is OK since the samples were
measured within a short time period and differences are thus expected to be
small. Also, hook peaks should ideally be present along the full retention time
range. Next we plot the base peak chromatograms before and after alignment to
get a general overview of the alignment performance.

```{r  bpc-raw-adjusted, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "BPC before (top) and after (bottom) alignment.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8 }
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
## Plot the raw base peak chromatogram
plot(bpc_raw)
## Plot the BPC after alignment
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, aggregationFun = "max")) 
```

The base peak chromatograms are nicely aligned after retention time
adjustment. The impact of the alignment should also be evaluated on known
compounds. We thus plot below the XIC for Serine before and after alignment.

```{r  serine-xic-adjusted, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "XIC for Serine before (left) and after (right) alignment", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4 }
## Use adjustedRtime parameter to access raw/adjusted retention times
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(4, 4.5, 1, 0.5))
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, mz = c(106.04, 106.06),
                  rt = c(179, 186), adjustedRtime = FALSE))
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, mz = c(106.04, 106.06),
                  rt = c(179, 186))) 
```

The Serine peaks are also nicely aligned after adjustment. Note that if we were
not happy with the alignment results we could simply retry with different
settings after removing old results with the `dropAdjustedRtime` function. This
function restores also the original retention times of the identified
chromatographic peaks.


### Correspondence

The final step of the LC-MS preprocessing with `xcms` is the correspondence
analysis, in which chromatographic peaks from the same ion are grouped across
samples to form a *feature*. `xcms` implements two methods for this purpose:
*peak density* [@Smith:2006ic] and *nearest* [@Katajamaa:2006jh] that can be
configured by passing either a `PeakDensityParam` or a `NearestPeaksParam`
object to the `groupChromPeaks` function. For our example we use the peak
density method that iterates through slices of m/z ranges of the data and groups
chromatographic peaks in each (within the same or in other samples) if they are
close enough in their retention time. Which peaks are grouped together is
defined based on the distribution of peaks along the retention time that is
estimated with the R `density` function. To illustrate this we extract below an
m/z slice containing the Serine peak and use the `plotChromPeakDensity` function
to visualize the distribution of peaks along the retention time axis and
*simulate* a correspondence based on the provided settings. This function thus
allows to test different settings for the correspondence on data subsets before
applying them on the full data set.

```{r  correspondence-example, message = FALSE, results = "hide", fig.cap = "BPC for a m/z slice and defined features within this slice based on default settings." }
## Plot the BPC for the m/z slice containing serine
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(4, 4.3, 1, 0.5))
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, mz = c(106.04, 106.06), aggregationFun = "max"))
highlightChromPeaks(data_cent, mz = c(106.04, 106.06),
                    whichPeaks = "apex_within")

## Get default parameters for the grouping
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group)

## Dry-run correspondence and show the results.
plotChromPeakDensity(data_cent, mz = c(106.04, 106.06),
                     type = "apex_within", param = pdp)
 
```

The upper panel in the plot above shows the chromatographic data with the
identified peaks. The lower panel shows the retention time of identified peaks
(x-axis) per sample (y-axis) with the black solid line representing their
distribution along the x-axis. Peak groups (features) are indicated with grey
rectangles. The default settings could thus successfully group the Serine peak
in each sample into a feature. The parameters for the peak density
correspondence analysis are:

- `binSize`: m/z width of the bin/slice of data in which peaks are grouped.
- `bw` defines the smoothness of the density function.
- `maxFeatures`: maximum number of features to be defined in one bin.
- `minFraction`: minimum proportion of samples (of one group!) for which a peak
  has to be present.
- `minSamples`: minimum number of samples a peak has to be present.

The parameters `minFraction` and `minSamples` depend on the experimental layout
and should be set accordingly. `binSize` should be set to a value small enough
to avoid that peaks from different ions, but with similar m/z, measured at about
the same retention time, would not be grouped together. The most important
parameter however is `bw` and, while its default value of 30 was able to
correctly group the Serine peaks, it should be evaluated also on other, more
complicated, signals. We thus evaluate the performance of the default parameters
on an m/z slice that contains also the isomers Betaine and Valine ([M+H]+ m/z
118.08625).

```{r  correspondence-bw, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Define correspondence settings to separate Betaine and Valine peaks.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10 }
par(mfrow = c(3, 1), mar = c(3, 4.3, 1, 1))

## Plot the chromatogram for an m/z slice containing Betaine and Valine
mzr <- 118.08625 + c(-0.01, 0.01)
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, mz = mzr, aggregationFun = "max"))
highlightChromPeaks(data_cent, mz = mzr, whichPeaks = "apex_within")

## Correspondence in that slice using default settings
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group)
plotChromPeakDensity(data_cent, mz = mzr, param = pdp, type = "apex_within")

## Reducing the bandwidth
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group, bw = 1.8)
plotChromPeakDensity(data_cent, mz = mzr, param = pdp, type = "apex_within") 
```

While with default settings all peaks in the m/z slice were grouped into a
single feature, reducing `bw` to 1.8 resulted in separate features for all
isomers. Below we perform the correspondence using the data-set specific
settings.

```{r  correspondence-analysis, message = FALSE }
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group, bw = 1.8,
                        minFraction = 0.4, binSize = 0.02)

## Perform the correspondence analysis
data_cent <- groupChromPeaks(data_cent, param = pdp) 
```

Correspondence analysis results should also be evaluated on some known
compounds. We thus check the results for another m/z slice that contains isomers
Leucine and Isoleucine ([M+H]+ m/z 132.10191). Setting `simulate = FALSE` in
`plotChromPeakDensity` will show the actual results from the correspondence
analysis.

```{r  correspondence-evaluate, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Result of correspondence on a slice containing the isomers Leucine and Isoleucine.", fig.width = 10, fig.heigt = 8 }
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(3, 4.3, 1, 1))

## Plot the chromatogram for an m/z slice containing Leucine and Isoleucine
mzr <- 132.10191 + c(-0.01, 0.01)
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, mz = mzr, aggregationFun = "max"))
highlightChromPeaks(data_cent, mz = mzr, whichPeaks = "apex_within")

plotChromPeakDensity(data_cent, mz = mzr, param = pdp, type = "apex_within",
                     simulate = FALSE) 
```

Despite being very close, peaks of isomers were successfully grouped into
separate features. The results from the correspondence analysis can be accessed
with the `featureDefinition` function. This function returns a data frame with
the rt and m/z ranges of the apex positions from the peaks assigned to the
feature and their respective indices in the `chromPeaks` matrix.

```{r  correspondence-featureDefinitions, message = FALSE }
## Definition of the features
featureDefinitions(data_cent) 
```

Also, we can calculate simple per-feature summary statistic with the
`featureSummary` function. This function reports for each feature the total
number and the percentage of samples in which a peak was detected and the total
numbers and percentage of these samples in which more than one peak was assigned
to the feature.

```{r  correspondence-featureSummary, message = FALSE }
## Per-feature summary.
head(featureSummary(data_cent)) 
```

The matrix with the feature intensities can be extracted with the
`featureValues` function. This function uses the feature definitions to extract
the requested value from each chromatographic peak assigned to the feature and
returns a matrix with rows being features and columns samples. The function
takes two additional parameters `value` and `method`: `value` defines the column
in the `chromPeaks` table that should be reported, and `method` the approach to
handle cases in which more than one peak in a sample is assigned to the
feature. Below we set `value = "into"` to extract the total integrated peak area
and `method = "maxint"` to report the peak area of the peak with the largest
intensity for features with multiple peaks in a sample.

```{r  correspondence-featureValue, message = FALSE }
## feature intensity matrix
fmat <- featureValues(data_cent, value = "into", method = "maxint")
head(fmat)
 
```

Among the first rows in that matrix we can spot an `NA` value. No peak was
assigned to the feature *FT002* in the second sample, either because peak
detection failed in that sample, or the corresponding ion is not present in that
sample. With the `fillChromPeaks` function, `xcms` provides the functionality to
*fill-in* missing peak data from the feature area (which is defined by the
median rt and m/z of all peaks assigned to the feature). Several settings allow
to increase this feature region in m/z and/or retention time dimension:
`expandMz` and `expandRt` expand the region relative to the width of the area in
either m/z or rt dimension. `expandMz = 1` would for example expand the regions
by half of each feature's m/z width on both sides hence resulting in regions
with an m/z width twice as big as the original width. Finally, `ppm` allows to
expand the m/z width of each region by an m/z dependent value. Note that in
future the function will gain two more settings `fixedMz` and `fixedRt` to
enable expansion of the feature area also by a constant value. Below we first
determine the number of missing values in the data matrix and subsequently use
`fillChromPeaks` to fill-in some missing peaks.

```{r  fillChromPeaks, message = FALSE }
## Number of missing values
sum(is.na(fmat))

## Define the settings for the fill-in of missing peaks
fpp <- FillChromPeaksParam(expandMz = 0.5, expandRt = 0.5, ppm = 20)
data_cent <- fillChromPeaks(data_cent, param = fpp)

## How many missing values after
sum(is.na(featureValues(data_cent)))

fmat_fld <- featureValues(data_cent, value = "into", method = "maxint")
head(fmat_fld) 
```

With `fillChromPeaks` we could *rescue* signal for all but 4 features with
missing values. Note that filled-in peak information can also be removed any
time with the `dropFilledChromPeaks` function. Also, setting `filled = FALSE` in
the `featureValues` function would return only data from detected peaks.

The data analysis would now continue on the feature matrix and could comprise
normalization of the abundances, identification of the compounds and
differential abundance analysis.

One final thing worth mentioning is that `XCMSnExp` objects keep, next to the
preprocessing results, also a history of all processing steps that have been
performed with it. This can be accessed with the `processHistory` function.

```{r  correspondence-result-object, message = FALSE }
## Overview of the performed processings
processHistory(data_cent)
```

Also all parameter objects defining the settings for each analysis step are
stored internally. Below we access for example the parameter object from the
first preprocessing step.

```{r  correspondence-history, message = FALSE }
## Access the parameter class for a processing step
processParam(processHistory(data_cent)[[1]])
```
